00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.500
Have you ever approached an intersection where the traffic lights are all flashing amber?

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.500
It can be stressful when the rules aren't clear. You might ask yourself who goes first?

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.800
Should I just go? Is it safe?

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.500
Things run a lot smoother when the rules are clearly communicated and everyone understands them.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.000
In your role, we rely on you to make decisions and commitments on behalf of our business.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.200
The authority given to you is called a Delegation,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.800
and it's important that you understand how and when you can exercise those responsibilities.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.300
This video and elearning course are designed to ensure you have the info you need

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.200
to make the best decisions when acting on behalf of our business.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:58.700
Our Delegations framework provides all the guidance you need. 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:04.000
It includes the Delegations relevant to your role and our Delegations Policy.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.900
Delegations have been grouped into five general categories:

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:14.400
Customer Revenue Contracts; Expenditure and Procurement; Standard Terms and Other Agreements;

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.500
Waivers, Compromises, Settlement of Disputes and Credit Notes; and Corporate Functions.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.500
You can download the Delegations of Authority from our corporate intranet

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.000
and check the listed activities in each category against your role.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.500
We're always improving our Delegations framework so take a moment to look at

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.000
the What's New section of the Delegations Framework page on our corporate intranet.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.600
You might change roles within Australia Post.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.400
In this case it's important to remember that Delegations are not issued to you as an individual,

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.000
they are issued to the specific position you occupy,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.100
and therefore your responsibilities change with you as your role changes.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.000
What won't change, are the key requirements:

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.700
You cannot sub-delegate your authority to another person.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.400
You cannot split payments or make unjustified estimates to accommodate lower authority limits.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.900
You cannot use your delegation unless it is necessary for, and directly relevant to your role.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.300
And you must comply with other applicable policies 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:23.800
for example, our Procurement Policy, our Revenue Contracts Playbook, our Conflicts of Interest Policy and Our Ethics.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.900
To help you make better decisions and commitments on behalf of our business,

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.700
